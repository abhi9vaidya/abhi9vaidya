## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **MERN stack developer** and **Computer Science student** who loves building smooth, scalable, and intuitive web applications.  
I specialize in crafting interfaces that feel fast, modern, and purposeful — backed by clean backend engineering.

I enjoy exploring real-time systems, deepening my understanding of web fundamentals, and creating digital experiences that feel effortless for users.

What drives me:
- Clean engineering  
- Fast UI performance  
- Seamless real-time interactions  
- Elegant technical design

## 🚀 What I Like Building

- Fast and clean **frontend interfaces** with smooth UX  
- **MERN apps** that follow real engineering standards  
- **Real-time experiences** (chat, presence, editors, dashboards)  
- **Auth systems** that feel frictionless  
- Tools that combine **design + engineering** into something simple and beautiful  

Not a fan of messy code, slow UI, or bloated architecture.

## 🧠 Engineering Approach

I believe great software should be:

### **Readable**
Code should explain itself without comments.

### **Lightweight**
Avoid complexity unless absolutely needed.

### **Performant**
Users should *feel* the speed immediately.

### **Consistent**
Interfaces should behave predictably, always.

### **Intentional**
Every component, every API needs a reason to exist.
