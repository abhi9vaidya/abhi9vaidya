# Hi, I'm Abhinav 👋

I build modern MERN applications with a focus on speed, clean UI, and solid engineering. I enjoy turning ideas into polished, functional interfaces and exploring better frontend and backend patterns.

### 🚀 About My Work
I’ve pinned the projects I’m proud of — the rest are hiding in private repos, waiting for a future version of me to refactor them.

Some of my apps are clean, some experimental, and a few were built at 2am and will never see daylight again.

*   🛠️ I build random things just to see if they *can* exist.
