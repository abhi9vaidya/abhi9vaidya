# Hi, I'm Abhinav 👋

I build fast, modern MERN applications with clean UI and reliable engineering.  
I enjoy turning ideas into production-ready experiences and exploring better frontend and backend patterns.

**Currently learning:** scalable backend systems, real-time features (WebSockets), and performance tuning.

### 🚀 What I Build
I like solving practical problems and iterating until things feel polished.

- 🔐 Auth-driven apps with sessions, JWT, and secure flows  
- 💬 Real-time chat and collaborative features  
- 📦 REST APIs with clean architecture and modular design  
- ⚡ Fast UI with reusable components and optimized bundles  

Some repos are public, some are experiments, and some are waiting for refactors before they return to daylight.

### ⚡ Outside of Code
- I pick up the guitar when problems stop making sense.  
- I build random tools just to see whether they *should* exist.  
- I refactor working code… because clean code matters.
