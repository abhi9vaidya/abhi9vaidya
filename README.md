## Hi, I'm Abhinav 👋

I build modern MERN applications with a focus on speed, clean UI, and solid engineering.  
I enjoy turning ideas into polished, functional interfaces and exploring better frontend and backend patterns.

My daily tools include **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, and **Vite**.  
Currently learning more about **scalable backend systems** and **real-time features**.

---

I’ve pinned the projects I’m proud of... the rest are hiding in private repos,  
waiting for a future version of me to refactor them.

Some of my apps are clean, some experimental,  
and a few were built at 2am and will never see daylight again.

### Fun Facts
- I pick up my guitar whenever code stops making sense.  
- I build random things just to see if they *can* exist.  
- I sometimes rewrite components that already work… because they could “look cleaner.”  
- **Hobbies:** building stuff, guitar, exploring new tech rabbit holes.
