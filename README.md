Hi, I'm Abhinav.

I build modern MERN applications with a focus on speed, clean UI, and good engineering.  
I enjoy turning ideas into polished, functional interfaces and exploring better frontend and backend patterns.

My daily tools include React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Vite.  
Currently learning more about scalable backend systems and real-time features.

I’ve pinned the projects I’m proud of — the rest are hiding in private repos,  
waiting for a future version of me to refactor them.

Some of my apps are clean, some experimental,  
and a few were built at 2am and will never see daylight again.

Fun Facts:
- I pick up my guitar whenever code stops making sense.
- I build random things just to see if they *can* exist.
- I sometimes rewrite components that already work… because they could “look cleaner.”
- Hobbies: building stuff, guitar, and exploring new tech rabbit holes.
